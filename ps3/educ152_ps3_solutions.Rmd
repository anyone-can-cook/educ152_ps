<br>

Some questions will ask you to write out notation and/or equations.

You can write out notation/equations one of two ways: (1) using "inline equations," which begin with a dollar sign \$ and end with a dollar sign \$; *OR* (2) you can write out notation/equation in plain text without. We encourage you to try inline equations, but fine if you do not.

Tips on writing notation/equations using "inline equations':

- Make sure there are no spaces after the dollar sign \$ that begins the equation and no spaces before the dollar sign that ends the equation. 
  - For example, you would write out the notation for treated potential outcome like this: $Y_i(1)$
  - But this wouldn't work: $ Y_i(1)$
  - And this wouldn't work: $Y_i(1) $
- Special characters -- like greek letters -- within inline equations are referred to using special symbols that start with a backslash
  - e.g., "Beta" is `\beta`: $\beta$
  - "Mu" (symbol for population mean) is `\mu`: $\mu$
- Subscripts after a character or symbol are specified like this:
  - e.g., "Beta subscript 1" is `beta_1`: $\beta_1$
  - e.g., "Mu subscript Y" (referring to population mean of variable Y) is `\mu_Y`: $\mu_Y$
- "hats" are specified by wrapping the character/symbol within curly brackets `\hat{}` like this:
  - e.g., "Beta hat" is `\hat{\beta}`: $\hat{\beta}$
  - e.g., "Beta hat subscript 1" is `\hat{\beta}_1` (note that the subscript is not within the "hat"): $\hat{\beta}_1$
- "bars" are specified by wrapping the character/symbol within curly brackets `\bar{}` like this:
  - e.g., "sample mean of Y" is `\bar{Y}`: $\bar{Y}$
- Don't worry about getting it perfect and don't spend too much time trying to get it perfect; if you are trying, that is a great start! and fine to use inline equations for some notation/equations and plain text for others that you can't figure out.  

<br>

Tips on writing notation/equations in plain text

- Instead of writing $Y_i(1)$, you could write this: Y_i(1)
- Instead of writing $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + u_i$, you could write this: Y_i = beta_0 + beta_1*X_i + u_i
- Instead of writing $\hat{Y_i} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1X_i$, you could write something like this: Y_hat_i = beta_hat_0 + beta_hat_1*X_i
- don't worry if it doesn't look pretty!

# Part I: Measures of model fit

<br>

<span style="color:red"><b>/X<b></span>

#### 1. Define $R^2$ in words. Write out the mathematical formula for $R^2$ using both ways discussed in lecture.


- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:  $R^2$ is the fraction of variance in Y explained by X (and is not already explained by sample mean, $\bar{Y}$). 

$R^2 = \frac{\text{variance in Y that is explained by X}}{\text{total variance in Y}} = \frac{ESS}{TSS}$

$R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{variance in Y not explained by X}}{\text{total variance in Y}} = 1 - \frac{SSR}{TSS}$


<span style="color:red"><b>/X<b></span>  

#### 2. Using the code from below to guide you, write out the formula for TSS and explain what it means in words. Do the same for ESS and SSR. 

Consider the research question, what is the relationship between cost of attendance ($X$) and earnings  ($Y$) (2 years after graduation)?

Below we use the `lm()` function and create an object named `mod1` that contains results from the bivariate regression of the relationship between cost of attendance ($X$) and earnings 2 years after graduation ($Y$). We run the `anova()` function to get the values of ESS, SSR, TSS. 

- X= `coa_grad_res`
- Y= `earn_mdn_hi_2yr`

```{r}
mod1 <- lm(formula = earn_mdn_hi_2yr ~ coa_grad_res, data = df_edu)

summary(mod1)

anova(mod1)

```

Estimated sum of squares (ESS) = 323638309  
Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR) = 10633742116  
Total Sum of Squares (TSS) = ESS + SSR = 10,957,380,425


- __YOUR ANSWER HERE: TSS__: 

$TSS = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i-\bar{Y})^2$

Total sum of squares measures the total variance in Y, in terms of $\bar{Y}$

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE: ESS__:

$ESS = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{Y_i}-\bar{Y})^2$  

Explained sum of squares measures the amount of variation in Y explained by X.

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE: SSR__: 

$SSR = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i-\hat{Y})^2$   

The sum of squared residuals measures the amount of variation in Y not explained by X.


<span style="color:red"><b>/X<b></span>   

#### 3. Using the values for ESS, SSR, and TSS from above, calculate $R^2$ in both ways discussed in lecture (can do it by hand below or in a code chunk). Interpret the value of $R^2$ in words. 

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__: The model explains 2.9% of the variation in Y (that is not already explained by sample mean, $\bar{Y}$)

```{r}
#ESS
anova(mod1)$"Sum Sq"[1]

#SSR
anova(mod1)$"Sum Sq"[2]

#TSS
anova(mod1)$"Sum Sq"[1] + anova(mod1)$"Sum Sq"[2]

#R2, ESS/TSS
anova(mod1)$"Sum Sq"[1] / (anova(mod1)$"Sum Sq"[1] + anova(mod1)$"Sum Sq"[2])

#R2, 1 - SSR/TSS
1 - anova(mod1)$"Sum Sq"[2] / (anova(mod1)$"Sum Sq"[1] + anova(mod1)$"Sum Sq"[2])
```



<span style="color:red"><b>/X<b></span> 

#### 4. Explain what sample standard deviation of a variable means in words and write out the formula. Explain what standard error of the regression (SER) means in words and write out the formula for SER (in terms of SSR). 

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__: 

Sample standard deviation = The sample standard deviation of Y $\hat{\sigma}_Y$ measures the average distance between a random observation $Y_i$ and the sample mean $\bar{Y_i}$. 

$\hat{\sigma}_Y = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i-\bar{Y})^2}{n -1}}$  

Standard error of the regression (SER) = The standard error of the regression is an estimate of how far away, on average, an actual observed value of $Y_i$ is from the predicted value of $\hat{Y_i}$ of $Y_i$ for a random observation, $i$. 

$SER = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i-\hat{Y_i})^2}{n -2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{\mu_i})^2}{n -2}}$  



<span style="color:red"><b>/X<b></span> 

#### 5. Run the analysis of the relationship between cost of attendance ($X$) and debt ($Y$)., do the following: run the regression in R (using `lm()` and `summary()`) and assign it to the object `mod2`; report the SER; and calculate the standard deviation of the dependent variable `sd()`, debt `debt_all_stgp_eval_mean`, in the regression model. 

- X= `coa_grad_res`
- Y= `debt_all_stgp_eval_mean`

```{r}
mod2 <- lm(formula = debt_all_stgp_eval_mean ~ coa_grad_res, data = df_edu)

summary(mod2)

#SER
summary(mod2)$sigma

#Standard deviation of debt
sd(df_edu$debt_all_stgp_eval_mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```


<span style="color:red"><b>/X<b></span> 

#### 6. Interpret the SER from the above model in words. Interpret sample standard deviation from above model in words. Does our model make our prediction substantially better? 


- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__: 

Interpretation of SER: On average, observed values of institution-level student debt ($Y_i$) are 9,931.327 dollars away from predicted values of institution-level student debt $\hat{Y_i}$.

Interpretation of sample standard deviation: On average, observations of $Y_i$ are 10,417.01 dollars away from the sample mean $\bar{Y_i}$ of Y.

- Yes, the model makes our prediction better. 


# Part II: Categorical X variables

<span style="color:red"><b>/X<b></span> 

#### 1. Explain what a reference group is in words.  

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:


<span style="color:red"><b>/X<b></span> 

#### 2. What is a factor variable and why is it important for running a regression?  

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:

<span style="color:red"><b>/X<b></span> 

#### 3.  For your analysis of the relationship between the level of urbanization by institution (X) and institution-level student earnings (Y) for graduates of MA programs in Education, do the following: write out the population linear regression model (label the symbols and write out what the variables $X$ and $Y$ actually represent); write out the OLS prediction line (without estimate values); write out the OLS prediction line (with estimate values); interpet the point estimate value of $\hat{\beta}_0$ in words; interpret the predicted average value for observations that have reference group for $X$.

- Some investigations of the variable categorical $X$ variable `urban`
```{r}
df_edu_fac %>% glimpse()

#value labels associated with variable urban
attr(df_edu$urban, which = 'labels')

attributes(df_edu_fac$urban)

df_edu_fac %>% count(urban)
```

- X= `urban`
- Y= `earn_mdn_hi_2yr`

```{r}
mod3 <- lm(formula = earn_mdn_hi_2yr ~ urban, data = df_edu_fac)
summary(mod3)
```


<span style="color:red"><b>/X<b></span> 

#### 4. Interpret $\hat{\beta}_k$ in words for each non-reference category of $X$.   

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:


#### 5. Use OLS prediction line to predict the value of $Y$ for each value of $X$ [show work].  
    - Reference group  
    - Non reference group 1  
    - Non reference group 2  
    - Non reference group 3  
    
- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:
    
#### 6. Write out the null and alternative hypotheses for each non-reference group category of variable $X$.   

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:


#### 7. Write out the formula for the t-statistic of $\hat{\beta}_k$. 
What does $SE\hat{\beta}_k$ mean in words; some question where they have to convey that they know it is about sampling distribution of Beta_hat_k; how value varies from one random sample to another  

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:

#### 8. For one of the non-reference group categories of $X$ do the following:  
  - Solve for value of t using information from the regression output
