__Overview__

<br>

Problem set 4 is the take-home final for EDUC152. As such, it is longer and more challenging than previous problem sets. Because this is a take-home final, we cannot answer questions except for providing clarification. If you need clarification on a question, please send us a DM and/or come to our office hours. 

The first part of the problem set asks to answer questions about the article by @RN3292:

- Cabrera, N. L., Milem, J. F., Jaquette, O., & Marx, R. (2014). Missing the (student achievement) forest for all the (political) trees: Empiricism and the Mexican American Studies controversy in Tucson. *American Educational Research Journal*, 51(6), 1084-1118.

The remainder of the problem set asks questions about the following research question, "What is the effect of taking developmental math courses in college ($X$) on student success ($Y$) for students who start postsecondary education at a community college and who have a delayed entry (at least a one-year delay between completing high school and starting college)?

- We will consider two different outcome variables, $Y$
  - (continuous) total number of credits earned in postsecondary education (across all insitutions attended)
  - (dichotomous) whether the student ever transferred to a four-year institution
- Developmental math courses, $X$, teach math skills that students are generally expected to learn in high school
  - These courses are sometimes referred to as "remedial" but I prefer the term developmental
  - Usually, students are assigned to developmental math courses based on their score in a placement exam or based on the recommendation of a community college guidance counselor
  - Generally, developmental math courses do not count for "college credit" but students must pass these courses before they can take college credit math courses
- Many researchers and policymakers have been critical about placing too many community college students in developmental math courses and recommend that most students should be placed immediately into college-level math courses.
- Our research question will assess whether taking developmental math courses helps or hinders the success of students who have a delayed entry to college (at least a one-year delay between completing high school and starting college)


<details><summary><span style="color:red"><b>Click here for tips on notation</b></span></summary>

<br>

Some questions will ask you to write out notation and/or equations.

You can write out notation/equations one of two ways: (1) using "inline equations," which begin with a dollar sign \$ and end with a dollar sign \$; *OR* (2) you can write out notation/equation in plain text without. We encourage you to try inline equations, but fine if you do not.

Tips on writing notation/equations using "inline equations':

- Make sure there are no spaces after the dollar sign \$ that begins the equation and no spaces before the dollar sign that ends the equation. 
  - For example, you would write out the notation for treated potential outcome like this: $Y_i(1)$
  - But this wouldn't work: $ Y_i(1)$
  - And this wouldn't work: $Y_i(1) $
- Special characters -- like greek letters -- within inline equations are referred to using special symbols that start with a backslash
  - e.g., "Beta" is `\beta`: $\beta$
  - "Mu" (symbol for population mean) is `\mu`: $\mu$
- Subscripts after a character or symbol are specified like this:
  - e.g., "Beta subscript 1" is `beta_1`: $\beta_1$
  - e.g., "Mu subscript Y" (referring to population mean of variable Y) is `\mu_Y`: $\mu_Y$
- "hats" are specified by wrapping the character/symbol within curly brackets `\hat{}` like this:
  - e.g., "Beta hat" is `\hat{\beta}`: $\hat{\beta}$
  - e.g., "Beta hat subscript 1" is `\hat{\beta}_1` (note that the subscript is not within the "hat"): $\hat{\beta}_1$
- "bars" are specified by wrapping the character/symbol within curly brackets `\bar{}` like this:
  - e.g., "sample mean of Y" is `\bar{Y}`: $\bar{Y}$
- Don't worry about getting it perfect and don't spend too much time trying to get it perfect; if you are trying, that is a great start! and fine to use inline equations for some notation/equations and plain text for others that you can't figure out.  

<br>

Tips on writing notation/equations in plain text

- Instead of writing $Y_i(1)$, you could write this: Y_i(1)
- Instead of writing $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + u_i$, you could write this: Y_i = beta_0 + beta_1*X_i + u_i
- Instead of writing $\hat{Y_i} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1X_i$, you could write something like this: Y_hat_i = beta_hat_0 + beta_hat_1*X_i
- don't worry if it doesn't look pretty!

# Part I: Questions about @RN3292

<span style="color:red"><b>/2<b></span>

#### 1. In a couple sentences, what was the Mexican American Studies program and who was allowed to participate?

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:   MAS was an interrelated set of courses offered at several schools within the Tucson Unified School district that students could opt in to starting in 11th grade. The program targeted low-income Mexican American students, and particularly students with low academic achievement. The program offered courses on language arts, literature, and history, with coursesdesigned to meet state standard but with a content focus on Mexican American culture and history. The courses were developed based on the work of "Paulo Freire (2000, 2008), especially the development of conscientizacxa˜o: the combination of critical consciousness, self-reflection, and engaging in antioppressive, collective action" [@RN3292, p. 1090].


<span style="color:red"><b>/2<b></span>

#### 2. In social science research a "mechanism" is an explanation for why one variable ($X$) has a causal effect on another variable ($Y$). In your own words, what are 2-3 mechanisms for why participation in the MAS program would have a positive causal effect on the probability of graduating from high school

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__: 

- Students may be more engaged in learning literature and and history from the perspective of their own culture rather than learning Eurocentric history and literature. When students are more engaged in school, academic performance, attendance, and -- in turn -- and the probability of graduation is likely to increase.
- The Freire-based pedagogy, which encourages self-reflection and encourages students to view themselves as agents of change, may also increase engagement with school. In turn, increased engagement is likely to positively affect the probability of graduation.


<span style="color:red"><b>/1<b></span>

#### 3. What does the conditional independendence assumption mean, in your own words?

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__: The conditional independence assumption states that the independent variable of interest is unrelated to variables that have been omitted from the model that affect the outcome variable.


<span style="color:red"><b>/2<b></span>

#### 4. What does omitted variable bias mean, in your own words? and what are the two conditions that must be satisfied for an omitted variable $Z$ to cause omitted variable bias? 

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:  Omitted variable bias is bias $\hat{\beta_k}$ due to variables being omitted from the model. For an omitted variable $Z$ to cause omitted variable bias, $Z$ must: (1) affect the value of $Y$ *and* (2) $Z$ must have a relationship with the independent variable of interest.


<span style="color:red"><b>/2<b></span>

#### 5. What is the connection between the conditional independence assumption and omitted variable bias?

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:  The conditional independence assumption is violated because the model excludes variables that satisfy both conditions of omitted variable bias.


<span style="color:red"><b>/1<b></span>

#### 6. If students had been randomly assigned to participate in MAS (as in an experiment), why would we be unconcerned about omitted variable bias?

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:  For omitted variable bias to occur, both conditions of omitted variable bias must be satisfied. If students had been randomly assigned to values of the MAS participation variable, then there can be omitted variables that affect the value of $Y$ (the first condition of omitted variable bias) but by definition these omitted variables can have no relationship with the MAS participation variable (the second condition of omitted variable bias) because values of MAS participation are determined by the flip of a coin.


<span style="color:red"><b>/3<b></span>

#### 7. In reality, students self-selected into MAS participation or non-participation. Think of one variable that might affect (positively or negatively) high school graduation *and* might be related (positively or negatively) to MAS participation? Why would this variable affect the probability of graduation and why might this variable have a relationship with participation in MAS? Why would we be concerned about our estimate of the effect of MAS based on a regression model that did not include this variable?

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:  Household income. First, household income affects the probability of high school graduation because low-income students may have to work and have less time to focus on school (first condition of omitted variable bias).  Second, the MAS program was designed to target low-income students (second condition of omitted variable bias) so there is likely a relationship between household income and program participation. Failure to include household income would result in (downward) omitted variable bias such that because the estimated effect of MAS participation is partially picking up the negative effect of being low-income on the probability of high school graduation.


<span style="color:red"><b>/1<b></span>

#### 8. In observational data (unit x not randomly assigned to values of $X$), when researchers use regression to estimate the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$, explain the primary strategy researchers use to eliminate (or at least reduce) omitted variable bias?

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__: The strategy to reduce omitted variable bias is to include "control" variables in the model that satisfy both conditions of omitted variable bias.


<span style="color:red"><b>/2<b></span>

#### 9. The "linear probability model" basically means applying ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to a dichotomous (0/1) outcome variable as opposed to a continuous outcome variable. In the linear probability model, what is the "generic" interpretation of $\hat{\beta}_1$ when $X_1$ is a categorical variable?

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:  The generic interpretation of $\hat{\beta}_1$ for the linear probability model when $X_1$ is a categorical variable is, "being in the “non-reference group” as opposed to the “reference group” is, on average, associated with a $\hat{\beta}_1 \times 100$ percentage point change in the probability of $Y=1$"


<span style="color:red"><b>/4<b></span>

#### 10. Below is a partial screenshot of Table 5 from @RN3292, where the dependent variable is a dichotomous measure of whether the student graduated from high school, and the independent variable of interest is a categorical measure of the number of MAS courses taken (reference group is zero MAS courses). Each column in Table 5 is a different regression model. Interpret the coefficients for the "All Cohorts" model in words


![](mas_table5.png)

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:  
  - taking one MAS course as opposed to taking zero MAS courses is associated with a (.051*100=) 5.1 percentage point increase in the probability of graduating from high school.
  - taking two MAS courses as opposed to taking zero MAS courses is associated with a (.088*100=) 8.8 percentage point increase in the probability of graduating from high school.
  - taking 3-4 MAS courses as opposed to taking zero MAS courses is associated with a (.115*100=) 11.5 percentage point increase in the probability of graduating from high school.
  - taking 5 or more MAS courses as opposed to taking zero MAS courses is associated with a (.159*100=) 15.9 percentage point increase in the probability of graduating from high school.




# Part II: Effect of developmental math on college credits

The code chunk below shows some descriptive statistics about the variables in the model. 

- The data frame we will use is `df_els_cc_delay`
  - each observation $i$ is a student
  - consists of students who started postsecondary education at a community college and who had at least a one-year delay between finishing high school and starting college
  - all categorical variables are factor class
  - Note: the data frame `df_els_cc` is the same as `df_els_cc_delay` but includes students who started at community college with no delay after finishing hich school
- The dependent variable, $Y$, is a continuous measure of the total number of postsecondary credits earned, across all institutions
  - measured by `f3tzpostern`
  - variable label: `r attr(df_els_cc_delay$f3tzpostern, which = 'label')`
- The independent variable, $X$, is a three-categorical measure of number of developmental math courses taken. We have several alternative versions of this variable:
  - label for the variable `dev_math_cat3`: `r attr(df_els_cc_delay$dev_math_cat3, which = 'label')`

```{r}

# dependent variable: number of postsecondary credits
df_els_cc_delay %>% summarize(
  mean_pse_cred = mean(f3tzpostern, na.rm = TRUE),
  sd_pse_cred = sd(f3tzpostern, na.rm = TRUE)
)

# independent variable: taking developmental math courses

  # three category
  df_els_cc_delay %>% count(dev_math_cat3)

  # four category
  #df_els_cc_delay %>% count(dev_math_cat4)
  
  # dichotomous
  #df_els_cc_delay %>% count(dev_math_01)
```

<span style="color:red"><b>/2<b></span>

#### 1. Our goal is to estimate the causal effect of taking development math courses ($X$) on number of postsecondary credits earned ($Y$) for the population of students who start at a community college and who have at least a one-year delay between finishing high school and starting college. Recall that a "mechanism" is an explanation for why one variable ($X$) has a causal effect on another variable ($Y$). Give one explanation for why taking developmental math courses ($X$) might have a negative causal effect on number of postsecondary credits earned ($Y$) for our population of interest (one or two sentences is fine). Give one explanation for why taking developmental math courses ($X$) might have a positive causal effect on number of postsecondary credits earned ($Y$) for our population of interest (one or two sentences is fine).

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__: 

- Developmental math courses ($X$) may have a negative causal effect on the number of postsecondary credits earned, ($Y$), because having to take developmental math courses, that perhaps do not count towards postsecondary credit, may result in less postsecondary credit earned if students have to pass these courses first in order to enroll in courses that count towards postsecondary credit. 

- Developmental math courses ($X$) may have a positive causal effect on the number of postsecondary credits earned ($Y$) because these developmental math courses may prepare students for other courses that count towards postsecondary credit and students will be able to do well in other classes.


<span style="color:red"><b>/8<b></span>

#### 2. Run the below model of the relationship between developmental math ($X$) and college credits earned ($Y$) with no control variables and then do the following.

Do the following:

- Write out the population linear regression model (make sure to define variables)
- Write out the OLS prediction line without estimate values
- Write out the OLS prediction line with estimate values
- Interpret the coefficients associated with developmental math in words
- For each coefficient associated with developmental math do we reject the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta_k = 0$ using an alpha-level (rejection region) of .05?
- Interpret the coefficient for $\hat{\beta_0}$ in words

```{r}
cred_mod1 <- lm(formula = f3tzpostern ~ dev_math_cat3, data = df_els_cc_delay)

summary(cred_mod1)
```

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:  

- Population linear regression model: $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{1i} + \beta_2X_{2i} + u_i$
- where:
  - subscript $i$ refers to student $i$
  - $Y_i$ = Postsecondary credits earned for student $i$ (variable `f3tzpostern`)
  - $X_i$ = Three-categorical measure of number of developmental math courses taken (measured by `dev_math_cat3`), which has the following three categories: 0 courses [reference group]; 1 course; 2+ courses  
    - $X_{1i}$: 0/1 “1 course”  
    - $X_{2i}$: 0/1 “2+ courses”
  - $\beta_0$ = ("population intercept"), average value of $Y$ when $X$ is the reference group category (that is $X_{1i}$=0,$X_{2i}$=0,$X_{3i}$=0
  - $\beta_1$ = population regression coefficient associated with taking  “1 developmental math course” rather than reference group "zero courses"
  - $\beta_2$ = population regression coefficient associated with taking “2+ more developmental math courses” rather than reference group "zero courses" 
  
  
- OLS prediction line (without estimates): $\hat{Y_i} = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1}X_{1i} + \hat{\beta_2}X_{2i}$

- where:
  - $\hat{Y_i}$ = predicted value of postsecondary credits earned (credits) for student $i$ (measured by variable `f3tzpostern`)
  - $\hat{\beta_0}$ = predicted value of $Y$ when all independent variables in the model ($X_1$,$X_2$,…$X_k$) are equal to 0. 
  - $\hat{\beta_1}$= predicted value of $Y$ when $X_1$ = 1 “1 developmental math course”.  
  - $\hat{\beta_2}$= predicted value of $Y$ when $X_2$ = 1 “2+ more developmental math courses”.    
  
  
- OLS prediction line (with estimates): $\hat{Y_i} =$  `r format(round(summary(cred_mod1)$coefficients[1,1], digits =2),big.mark = ',')` + `r format(round(summary(cred_mod1)$coefficients[2,1], digits =2),big.mark = ',')` $\times X_{1i}$ + `r format(round(summary(cred_mod1)$coefficients[3,1], digits =2),big.mark = ',')` $\times X_{2i}$ 


- Interpretation of $\hat{\beta_1}=$ `r format(round(summary(cred_mod1)$coefficients[2,1], digits =2),big.mark = ',')` (1 developmental math course)
  - "Taking one developmental math course as opposed to zero developmental math courses is, on average, associated with a `r format(round(summary(cred_mod1)$coefficients[2,1], digits =2),big.mark = ',')` credit increase in postsecondary credits earned, holding the value of all other X variables constant."
- Interpretation of $\hat{\beta_2}=$ `r format(round(summary(cred_mod1)$coefficients[3,1], digits =2),big.mark = ',')` (2+ more developmental math courses)
  - "Taking two or more developmental math courses as opposed to zero developmental math courses is, on average, associated with a `r format(round(summary(cred_mod1)$coefficients[3,1], digits =2),big.mark = ',')` credit increase in postsecondary credits earnedm, holding the value of all other X variables constant." 
  
  
- For each coefficient associated with developmental math do we reject the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta_k = 0$ using an alpha-level (rejection region) of .05?

$H_0: \beta_1 = 0$
$H_a: \beta_1 \ne 0$ 

- Interpretation: Under the assumption that $H_0: \beta_1 =0$ is true, there is a `r round(summary(cred_mod1)$coefficients[2,4]*100, digits = 1)` percent chance of obtaining a point estimate $\hat{\beta_1}$ as far away from the hypothesized value ($\beta_1 =0$) as the one we observed.   
  - p-value of `r round(summary(cred_mod1)$coefficients[2,4], digits = 4)` is greater than the alpha-level of `0.05`, so we do not reject $H_0$.

$H_0: \beta_2 = 0$
$H_a: \beta_2 \ne 0$ 

- Interpretation: Under the assumption that $H_0: \beta_2 =0$ is true, there is a `r round(summary(cred_mod1)$coefficients[3,4]*100, digits = 1)` percent chance of obtaining a point estimate $\hat{\beta_2}$ as far away from the hypothesized value ($\beta_2 =0$) as the one we observed.   
  - p-value of `r round(summary(cred_mod1)$coefficients[3,4], digits = 4)` is less than the alpha-level of `0.05`, so we reject $H_0$.


- Interpretation of $\hat{\beta_0}=$ 
  - `r format(round(summary(cred_mod1)$coefficients[1,1], digits =2),big.mark = ',')` is the predicted postsecondary credits earned for students who did not take any developmental math courses. 
 
 
<span style="color:red"><b>/3<b></span>

#### 3. Define $R^2$ in words. Write out the mathematical formula for $R^2$ and interpret the value of $R^2$ from the above model in words

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__: 

- The $R^2$ is the fraction of the variance in Y that is explained by X (and is not already explained by $\bar{Y}$). 

- $R^2 = \frac{\text{variance in Y that is explained by X}}{\text{total variance in Y}} = \frac{\text{Explained Sum of Squares}}{\text{Total Sum of Squares}} =  \frac{ESS}{TSS} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{Y_i}-\bar{Y})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i-\bar{Y})^2}$

- The model above explains 2.6% of the variation in Y (not already explained by $\bar{Y}$.)


<span style="color:red"><b>/3<b></span>

#### 4. Explain what standard error of the regression (SER) means in words, write out the formula for SER (in terms of SSR), and interpret the value of SER from the above model in words

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__: 

- Sample standard error of the regression (SER) is an estimate of how far away, on average, the observed value of $Y_i$ is from the predicted value $\hat{Yi}$ of $Y_i$ for a random observation $i$. 

- $SER = \sqrt{\frac{SSR}{n-2}}= \sqrt{ \frac {\sum_{i=1}^{n} ({Y_{i} -\hat{Y})^2}} {n-2} } = \sqrt{ \frac {\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{u_{i}})^2} {n-2}}$

- On average, observed values of postsecondary credits earned ($Y_i$) are `r format(round(summary(cred_mod1)$sigma, digits=2),big.mark = ',')` credits away from predicted values of postsecondary credits earned $\hat{Y}_i$.


<span style="color:red"><b>/3<b></span>

#### 5. Explain what sample standard deviation of a variable means in words and write out the formula. Interpet the value of standard deviation for the variable `f3tzpostern` (given below) in words. Using your judgment, does our regression model make our predictions about the value of `f3tzpostern` substantially better than just using the sample mean of `f3tzpostern`?


```{r}
# standard deviation of Y
sd(df_els_cc_delay$f3tzpostern, na.rm = TRUE)

# Standard error of the regression
summary(cred_mod1)$sigma
```

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__: 

- Sample standard deviation of a variable is an estimate of how far away, on average, the observed value of $Y_i$ is from the sample mean $\bar{Yi}$ of $Y_i$ for a random observation $i$. 

- $\hat{\sigma_{Y}} = s_{Y} =  \sqrt{ \frac {\sum_{i=1}^{n} ({Y_{i} -\overline{Y})^2}} {n-1} }$

- On average, observations of $Y_i$ are 47 postsecondary credits away from the sample mean $\bar{Y}$ of Y.

- The model does a better job at predicting the value of `f3tzpostern`. Although, I wouldn't say it does a *substantially* better job. 


<span style="color:red"><b>/4<b></span>

#### 6. Now, we will start adding "control" variables to our model. We will add ,`bytxmstd`, a continuous measure of high school standardized math score, and `f2everdo` a dichotomous categorical measure of whether the student ever had a "dropout episode" in high school. Run the below code which provides descriptive statistics of these variables. Separately for each of these variables, answer the following: Why might this variable satisfy the fist condition of omitted variable bias? Why might this variable satisfy the second condition of omitted variable bias?

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:  

- The variable `bytxmstd`
    - High school standardize math score, `bytxmstd`, affects value of postsecondary credits earned (e.g. scoring high on standardized math score could suggest students are prepared for college-level courses and may enroll in more postsecondary courses).
    - High school standardize math score, `bytxmstd`, has a relationship with developmental courses taken (e.g., score high on standardized math score means less, if at all, developmental courses to take).
    
- The variable `f2everdo`
    - Dropout episode in high school, `f2everdo`, affects value of postsecondary credits earned (e.g. perhaps student may take a break from college, for many reasons, and take less courses (earn less postsecondary credits).
    - Dropout episode in high school, `f2everdo`, has a relationship with developmental courses taken (e.g., if a student dropped out at some point in high school, they may have missed important math related courses and will perhaps need to take more developmental math courses to prepare for college-level math courses).

Descriptive statistics

```{r}
# continuous control, high school math standardized test score
df_els_cc_delay %>% summarize(
  mean_hs_math = mean(bytxmstd, na.rm = TRUE),
  min_hs_math = min(bytxmstd, na.rm = TRUE),
  max_hs_math = max(bytxmstd, na.rm = TRUE),
  sd_hs_math = sd(bytxmstd, na.rm = TRUE)
)

# dichotomous measure of whether student ever had a dropout episode
df_els_cc_delay %>% count(f2everdo)

# dichotomous measure of whether student ever had a dropout episode, showing integer values rather than factor levels
df_els_cc_delay %>% count(as.integer(f2everdo))
```


<span style="color:red"><b>/10<b></span>

#### 7. Run the below model of the relationship between developmental math ($X$) and college credits earned ($Y$) with the inclusion of control variables, and then do the following:

Do the following:

- Write out the population linear regression model (make sure to define variables)
- Write out the OLS prediction line without estimate values
- Write out the OLS prediction line with estimate values
- Interpret the coefficients associated with developmental math in words
- Interpret the coefficient associated with high school math score in words
- For each coefficient associated with developmental math do we reject the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta_k = 0$ using an alpha-level (rejection region) of .05?
- Interpret the coefficient associated with "ever dropped out" in words

- For each coefficient associated with developmental math do we reject the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta_k = 0$ using an alpha-level (rejection region) of .05?

$H_0: \beta_1 = 0$
$H_a: \beta_1 \ne 0$

  - p-value of `r round(summary(cred_mod2)$coefficients[2,4], digits = 4)` is greater than the alpha-level of `0.05`, so we do not reject $H_0$.

#### 8. With respect to the above model, interpret the value of $R^2$ in words (fine to use "R-squared" rather than "adjusted R-squared") and interpret the value of SER in words

- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__: The model explains 5% of the variation in Y (not already explained by $\bar{Y}$.). On average, observed values of postsecondary credits earned ($Y_i$) are `r format(round(summary(cred_mod2)$sigma, digits=2),big.mark = ',')` credits away from predicted values of postsecondary credits earned $\hat{Y}_i$.

#### 9. Choose two additional control variables that you think satisfy both conditions of omitted variable bias that you will add to the model. Separately for each of these two variables, answer the following: why might this variable satisfy the fist condition of omitted variable bias? Why might this variable satisfy the second condition of omitted variable bias? If the variable is categorical, which category will be used as the "reference category" when we include this variable in a regression model?

Note: to help you think of control variables you might add to your model, the below code shows variable labels associated with each variable (output omitted)
```{r, include=FALSE}
df_els_cc_delay %>% var_label()
```


- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__: 

`f1pared`: parents' highest level of education 
- 1. The variable `f1pared`, could affect our outcome, postsecondary credits earned, because students who have a parent with a higher level of education may have more postsecondary credits earned (e.g., say for example if their parents encourage them to take community college courses in high school). 
- 2. The variable `f1pared`, could have a relationship with developmental courses taken because having one or two parents with a college degree (higher level of education) could mean having access to other resources (e.g., tutoring, AP courses, etc) and therefore students may not need to take developmental courses (can test out of it.).
- Did not finish high school will be the reference group.

`parent_income`: parental income
- 1. The variable `parent_income` could affect our outcome, postsecondary credits earned because perhaps students who have a higher parental income could have attended a high school with many resources including more AP course offerings or partnerships with community colleges/universities and therefore could have earned postsecondary credit in high school. 
- 2. The variable `parent_income` could have a relationship with developmental courses taken because having (higher income) could mean having access to other resources (e.g., tutoring, AP courses, etc) and therefore students may not need to take developmental courses (can test out of it.).

#### 10. Run the regression model with the inclusion of the two new control variables you identified above. Create an object called `cred_mod3` with the results of this regression model and then summarize the object `cred_mod3`. 

_Note_: if you are having trouble adding variables to your model or the output looks odd, send a DM on slack to Patricia Martín for help.

```{r}
cred_mod3 <- lm(formula = f3tzpostern ~ dev_math_cat3 + bytxmstd + f2everdo + f1pared + parent_income, data = df_els_cc_delay)

summary(cred_mod3)
```


<span style="color:red"><b>/6<b></span>

#### 11. Answer the following questions based on the regression model associated with `cred_mod3`:

- Interpret the coefficients associated with developmental math in words
- For each coefficient associated with developmental math do we reject the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta_k = 0$ using an alpha-level (rejection region) of .05?
- Interpret two coefficients associated with the new control variables you decided to add to your model
  - Note: If you added a categorical variable with six categories, this would be associated with five regression coefficients. You don't have to interpret the coefficients for all five coefficients. You could just interpret two of these coefficients.

##### 12. Below we show the regression output associated with the model `cred_mod2` (control variables are high school math score and ever-droppoed out of high school). `cred_mod2` is based on the data frame `df_els_cc_delay` which includes students who started at a community college and had at least a one-year delay between finishing high school and starting college. We also show the regression output from the model `cred_mod2_allcc`, includes the same variables as `cred_mod2` but is based on the data frame which includes all students who started at community college, regardless of whether they delayed entry between high school and college. After running the below models, answer the following questions:


Questions to answer:

- Interpret the coefficients associated with developmental math from the model `cred_mod2_allcc`.
- In a couple of sentences, why do you think these coefficients are different than the coefficients from the model `cred_mod2`?

```{r}
cred_mod2 <- lm(formula = f3tzpostern ~ dev_math_cat3 + bytxmstd + f2everdo, data = df_els_cc_delay)

summary(cred_mod2)

cred_mod2_allcc <- lm(formula = f3tzpostern ~ dev_math_cat3 + bytxmstd + f2everdo, data = df_els_cc)

summary(cred_mod2_allcc)
```


- __YOUR ANSWER HERE__:  

- Interpretation of $\hat{\beta_1}=$ `r format(round(summary(cred_mod2_allcc)$coefficients[2,1], digits =2),big.mark = ',')` (1 developmental math course)
  - "Taking one developmental math course as opposed to zero developmental math courses is, on average, associated with a `r format(round(summary(cred_mod2_allcc)$coefficients[2,1], digits =2),big.mark = ',')` credit decrease in postsecondary credits earned, holding the value of all other X variables constant."
- Interpretation of $\hat{\beta_2}=$ `r format(round(summary(cred_mod2_allcc)$coefficients[3,1], digits =2),big.mark = ',')` (2+ more developmental math courses)
  - "Taking two or more developmental math courses as opposed to zero developmental math courses is, on average, associated with a `r format(round(summary(cred_mod2_allcc)$coefficients[3,1], digits =2),big.mark = ',')` credit increase in postsecondary credits earned, holding the value of all other X variables constant."
  
- The coefficients for the model `cred_mod2_allcc` may be different from the model `cred_mod2` (sample of students who delayed at least one year) because students who delayed may find it helpful to take developmental courses to get them up to speed with college-level courses. On the other hand, students who start at a community college and take developmental courses may extend their time to degree and deter them from taking postsecondary courses (e.g., perhaps lose motivation).


# Part III: Effect of developmental math on transfer to 4-yr

The below code shows descriptive statistics for the dichotomous variable `f3tzever4yr`, which identifies whether the student ever attended a 4-year institution, for our sample of students who started at a community college and had at least a one-year delay between finishing high school and starting college
```{r}
df_els_cc_delay %>% count(f3tzever4yr)
```


The below code runs a model of the relationship between developmental math ($X$) and a dichotomous measure of whether the student ever transferred to a four-year institution ($Y$), controlling for high school math score and whether the student ever dropped out of high school.

```{r}
transfer_mod1 <- lm(formula = as.integer(f3tzever4yr) ~ dev_math_cat3 + bytxmstd + f2everdo, data = df_els_cc_delay)
